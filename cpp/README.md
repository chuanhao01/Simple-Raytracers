# CPP based Raytracer

First raytracer I made based on the code and guide from [RayTracingInOneWeekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html).

Did not really like the CPP codebase and in generally, fely like I needed to learn more CPP than coding the thing out itself. Had CPP experience before, but realized I need a lot more to be good at developing in CPP.
