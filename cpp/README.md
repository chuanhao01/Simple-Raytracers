# CPP based Raytracer

First raytracer I made based on the code and guide from [RayTracingInOneWeekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html).

Did not really like the CPP codebase and in generally, fely like I needed to learn more CPP than coding the thing out itself. Had CPP experience before, but realized I need a lot more to be good at developing in CPP.

## Quickstart

Requires:

- CMake
- clang (Could work with gcc, but only tested with clang)

To setup, compile, build, run the raytracer and save its output as an image

- cmake .
- make
- ./bin/raytracer > image.ppm

## VSCode settings

Do also remember to customize the `.vscode` settings based on your platform and setup.
